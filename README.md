# Introduction
MBTCover is a tool for code-level and requirement-level test coverage measurement of model-based testing. 

The current implementation of MBTCover is for the [GraphWalker](http://graphwalker.github.io) open-source model-based testing (MBT) tool.

MBTCover measures and reports, live, the code coverage values of a web application under test while an MBT test suite is running using the GraphWalker MBT tool. The goal is to measure and display both clients-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) code coverage values. 

The first version of the tool was released in May 2020. New features are currently being added to it regularly.

## Demo videos
### A demo video of the second version of the tool, showing coverage values live (September 2020)
In this video, we demonstrate a live execution of the MBTCover tool, while the MBT test execution is running using the GraphWalker MBT tool. The System Under Test (SUT) is a large test-automation management tool named [Testinium](http://testinium.com).

### More videos to be added
More videos showing the tool's features and benefits, will be published in future, as we add more features to this coverage tool.

## User manual and Design document
We have the user manual and design document of the first version of the tool (which was released back in May 2020). The PDF file can be found [here](https://github.com/vgarousi/MBTCover/blob/master/docs/MBTCover-User%20guide%20and%20Design%20document-May%2010.pdf).
